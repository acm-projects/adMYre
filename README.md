# Tech Stack

- **Wireframes**: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (free trial)
- **IDE**: Android Studio 
- **Frontend**: Flutter or React Native 
  -	Flutter
    -	Has a bunch of premade widgets, compatible with both ios and android, can customize UI easily 
    -	Dart is not a very popular language (made by google) but the documentation is pretty good   
    -	Video explaining what [flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9ceqw5Ny-4)
    -	[General documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
  -	React Native
    -	uses JavaScript, a lot of resources and information available (more popular, developed dev community) 
    - [General documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
    - [React Native CLI vs Expo](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/react-native-cli-vs-expo-cli-which-one-do-i-choose-bdf02ea457bf)
      - Expo: typically quicker to learn, has own set of basic libraries for a standard project: Push Notifications, Asset Managers, etc 
      - React Native: can add native modules/code libraries  
- **Backend**: Dart (if flutter is chosen) and JavaScript (if ReactNative is chosen)
  - [Affirmations API](https://www.jsonapi.co/public-api/Affirmations) - returns JSON
  - Firebase or MongoDB for database --> [comparison](https://echoinnovateit.com/mongodb-vs-firebase/] (leaning towards Firebase)  
    - [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)
